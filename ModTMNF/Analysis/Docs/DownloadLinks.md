  - Unofficial patch. This removes the StarForce DRM from `TmNationsESWC.exe` (as such removes the dependency on `tmn.exe`, `tmn.dll`, `tmn.dat`).
  - The .rar contains additional .gbx files which were originally in the .dat file.
  - The binary is a different size to the original one as the original is packed with StarForce(3.07.012.005 / 3.7.19.5 (1.8.0 TMNF update)).
  - The binary was unpacked by russian cracker `KRBDZSKL` and apparently posted it on `rutracker.ru`. It was then reuploaded [here](https://www.old-games.ru/forum/threads/obnovlenija-ot-krbdzskl-shlak43-cyberdemon-i-neizvestnogo.85661) which links to [this](https://cloud.mail.ru/public/iYvU/3PdAhoPsm) folder which has a download with a file name of `Trackmania Nations Electronic Sports World Cup (ESWC).zip` inside the zip is `TmNationsESWC_1.80.rar`. This `.rar` shares the same hashes as the the `mega.nz` link (which was made by `St1ngLeR` for a YouTube guide who renamed the .rar clarity).
  - As with most unpacks; this process was not documented and anything could have been inserted into the binary. Given the number of niche old games that this person has worked on it's probably safe.

It would be useful if the unpacking process of `TmNationsESWC.exe` was recreated and made open source (whether that be exact written instructions, a video, or an open source tool).
